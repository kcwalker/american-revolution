            <p>This class will examine America's "dual revolution": the anti-colonial movement
                    that established the first republic in the Western Hemisphere, and the effort to 
                    implement a new national government in lieu of the monarchial regimes that 
                    the war had toppled. We will examine the ideas and people that were shaped and shaped
                    the American Revolution from the rather abstract ideas of French and Scottish thinkers 
                    during the Enlightenment to the more concrete wars in North America starting with the French and
                    Indian War. We will also examine the roles that traditionally disenfranchised (women, Blacks, and First Nations)
                    peoples have played in the war effort. We will finally look at how this fight for freedom inspired other
                    revolutionary movements, starting with France and Haiti. </p>
