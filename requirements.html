                <p>Attendance is mandatory. Four unexcused absences will be grounds for a lowered grade.
                    Six unexcused absences will result in failure of the course. Please come to class prepared,
                    having read the assigned texts and ready to discuss them. There will be 12 reaction papers, all due
                    at the beginning of the Thursday class meeting. Reaction papers serve a dual purpose.
                    First, they show that you have been keeping pace with the readings. Since this class goes at a 
                    quick pace, I expect you to stay on top of the material. The second is that is we will use them 
                    as a springboard for class discussion. I will drop your two lowest grades among them. There
                    will be a midterm and a final. Periodic opportunities for extra credit will be available throughout 
                    the course.</p>
